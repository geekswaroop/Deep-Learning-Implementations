# Deep Learning Concepts
## Description:
This repository contains my work on Advanced Deep Learning concepts using Keras with Tensorflow as Backend. Contains implementations of
* Basic Keras Functional API
* Categorical Embedding
* Two-Input Network, Shared & Merged Layers
* Multiple Input-Output 

## Data-sets Used:

I have used 2 data-sets in this repository. The data-sets correspond to the college basketball data from 1989-2017. The 1st data-set(*games_season*) has the following features

- Team ID 1
- Team ID 2
- Home vs Away
- Score Difference(Team 1-Team 2)
- Team 1 score
- Team 2 score

The second data-set(*games_tourney*) is the data-set on which we will be predicting and is the same as *games_season* with an additional feature of Seed Difference(*seed_diff*)
